# :wave: Welcome! 

I'm Faris Khalil, the owner of this GitHub profile.

The place may not seem so furnished, but I can assure you it won't always be like that... :eyes:

## Professional Snapshot

:mortar_board: I graduatated with distinction from Toronto Metropolitan University in May 2024 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

:bank: I was a Software Engineer Co-op at TD Bank for eight months in 2022, where I investigated production bugs to find root causes and to provide solutions.

:desktop_computer: I served as a site reliability engineer and a software developer at Wavelo in 2023, where I maintained an internal web application and monitored our infrastructure with Grafana.

## Beyond the IDE...

:video_game: Video games have entertained for a very long time. My favourite titles range from racing games (NR2003, Gran Turismo) to action-adventure (Uncharted) to open world (Zelda - The Wild Era)

:racing_car: I'm an avid motorsport fan, probably easy to tell based on some of my repositories :slightly_smiling_face:. Sunday = Race Day.

:weight_lifting_man: While I'm still a novice, I've made it a habit to exercise regularly. My routines aren't impressive, but at least I have one!

## What am I working on?

As of writing (August 7th), I'm currently working on a project that stores results and statistics with exported HTML files from the racing game NR2003. 
It's a way for me to keep myself fresh, and I'm learning Flask while I'm at it!
